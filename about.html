            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to leverage technology to solve one of the most pressing global issues: food waste. By using AI, we efficiently match surplus food from restaurants and supermarkets with local NGOs who can redistribute it to communities in need. This system not only helps reduce waste but also provides a sustainable way to tackle food insecurity and improve social welfare.</p>
            <p>With our platform, businesses can save on food disposal costs, NGOs can receive more consistent donations, and together we can create a ripple effect that benefits both the environment and society.</p>
